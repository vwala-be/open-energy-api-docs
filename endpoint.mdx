The public API is hosted by Vwala and available at:

```
https://open-energie.api.vwala.be
```

All data exposed through the API—such as merchants, products, distribution costs, excise duties, and related information is publicly available on the internet and not considered sensitive.

The API is hosted in Belgium, and all data is stored and processed within Belgium.

To generate an API key, only a verified email address is required. No other personal data is collected or stored. Developer authentication (sending the OTP) is powered by [Stytch](https://stytch.com/) so your email address is stored in Stytch's systems for authentication purposes.
