description: "Structured, open access to energy tariff data in Belgium."
---

We believe **pricing data should be open infrastructure**—available to everyone in a structured, machine-readable form. The **Open Energy API** is our contribution: **a public open data API** that gives anyone access to energy tariff information in 🇧🇪.

**An initiative by Vwala.** Built on a Sunday for a hackathon. Are you an energy supplier, regulator, consumer, or developer and interested in helping build this data platform? [Send us an email](mailto:nick@vwala.be)! We're open for collaboration and even making it open source 👀.

## What you can do

- **Browse** energy suppliers (merchants) and their products—electricity and gas, with pricing, characteristics, and versioned tariff cards
- **Retrieve** normalized cost components: energy cost, distribution costs, excise duties, and discounts
- **Run simulations** and calculations on top of a single, reliable data source

Data currently covers the **Flanders** region only. The API is **free for non-commercial use**.

## Data covered

| Resource | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Merchants** | Energy suppliers and metadata |
| **Products** | Electricity and gas products, price models, characteristics, versioned tariffs. Also allows running a simulation which calculates total energy cost, injection fee, and applicable discounts. |
| **Distribution costs** | Gas and electricity by year and distribution net provider |
| **Excise duties** | Gas and electricity excise rates by year |

## Disclaimer

This API is publicly accessible, but we can currently not make guarantees regarding the accuracy, completeness, or availability of the data, nor the uptime of the service.
