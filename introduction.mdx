description: "Structured, open access to energy tariff data in Belgium."
---

We believe **pricing data should be open infrastructure**—available to everyone in a structured, machine-readable form. The **Open Energy API** is our contribution: **a public open data API** that gives anyone access to energy tariff information in 🇧🇪.

## What you can do

- **Browse** energy suppliers (merchants) and their products—electricity and gas, with pricing, characteristics, and versioned tariff cards
- **Retrieve** normalized cost components: energy cost, distribution costs, excise duties, and discounts
- **Run simulations** and calculations on top of a single, reliable data source

Data currently covers the **Flanders** region only. The API is **free for non-commercial use**.

## Data covered
